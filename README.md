# Juan Manuel Lovera Personal Webpage

## About

This is my personal webpage project were you can find important information about me including:

* Education
* Experience
* Skills
* Hobbies
* Contact

This project was made for the [Web Development](http://johnguerra.co/classes/webDevelopment_spring_2018/students/index.html) course here at the [Universidad de los Andes](https://uniandes.edu.co/en).

## Technologies

I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Jquery and the wow.js library.

## Interesting details

Some sections of the HTML code were generated by javascript, who loads data from json files and inserts code hierarchically from a parent id division.

You can check the preview [here](jmalovera10.github.io).
